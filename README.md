# App Description

I was curious, why Gmail/Exchange and other email providers, qualify messages as SPAM.

As AI/ML is not my scope of interests, I've decided to use Apache Spamassasin - https://spamassassin.apache.org/ for emails analysis, as it provides reports with explanation why message was qualified.

My month-work is small system which allows multiple users to analyze their mailboxes content concurrently.

I use some hacks over celery to make it happen and bypass IMAP limitations like, not allowing for simultaneous connections.

To allow for concurrent mailboxes analysis, workers are created dynamically for each user. Each user has its own worker and two queues. Queue for downloading messages, and queue for spam analysis.

To bypass IMAP simultaneous connections problem, each message is seperate task send to rabbitMQ, with retry policy and time delay. If connections collision is in place, system waits, and try again until the goal (downloading message) is accomplished.

By default workers are deleted, each 24h, if there are no pending/active tasks in their queues.
